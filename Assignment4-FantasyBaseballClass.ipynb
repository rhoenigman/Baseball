You've heard about WAR and wOBA and replacement value and all sorts of ways to evaluate players, and now we're going to turn it into a competition with (fake) money on it (and a prize at the end). "

The least a player can go for is \\\\$1, while the most is \\\\$250-(# roster spots - 1). You'll have to use your money wisely to build the best team possible, however you can still use waivers and trades to keep your roster competitive."

A 2B/3B/HR is added on to the value of a hit, so a double is worth 5.6+2.9=8.5 points. These weights are based on wOBA/FIP, adjusted to keep pitchers and batter on a reatively level playing field. OF is any outfield position. UTIL is any batter, doesn't matter the position (kind of like a DH)."

   "source": [
    "No worries, in order to help even out the playing field a bit, here are some hints that can help you in the draft.  \n",
    "1. Try to get other people to spend their money on players that you don't want but you think that other people will. You can use ESPN draft rankings you help find discrepencies between your rankings and the ones that other people will see to help with that.  \n",
    "2. There's more than one strategy to building a team. You can blow all your money on some top tier talent and fill in the rest of your team with cheap players, or build a more balanced roster. Both can work.  \n",
    "3. There's position scarcity in baseball (some positions are deeper than others), meaning that the worst 2B on a roster might put up 1.9 points a game while the worst 1B on a roster might put up 2.5. Establishing a replacement level *wink wink* for each position can help you guage which players are more valuable just becuase of the position they play. \n",
    "4. Fantasy value does not always equal real life value. We don't care about defense and players have to play to score points. There might be some great guy sitting on an MLB teams bench, but he's not going to give you fantasy points if he's only playing every third day. Here, counting stats matter.  \n",
    "5. The league is only going to last a little over a month (the last day of points scoring will be 11:59pm on April 28th), meaning that prospects or players that won't be called up until midway through the season (Vlad Jr., Eloy) aren't realy worth drafting. You're welcome to ask if you don't know who those players are."
